            <p>I am a third-year Software Engineer student at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences.<br /><br />
            At the moment I am interested in web design/development and therefore I am eagerly learning new things in this field. I add all my interesting projects here so it is more easy to see what projects I have done and been part of.</p>
