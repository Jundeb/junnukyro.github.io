        <p>
          I’m a Software Engineering graduate from Oulu University of Applied
          Sciences and currently working as a Junior Software Engineer. I’m
          passionate about web development and always eager to learn and grow in
          the dynamic tech field.
          <br />
          <br />
          In my free time, I enjoy game development, 3D modeling, and exploring
          UI/UX design. I also work on personal projects to expand my portfolio
          and challenge myself creatively.
