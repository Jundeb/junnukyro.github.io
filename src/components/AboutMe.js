            <p>I am a second year software engineer student at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences. <br /><br />
            Before I got selected for Degree Programme in Information Technology, I had zero experience in programming, but now I feel that the days are too short for feeding my raging passion towards it.<br /><br />
            I am eagerly learning new things on software developing/engineering field and right now I am very interested on UI/UX desing and development. I build this portfolio website for showing my projects and telling a bit about myself.</p>
